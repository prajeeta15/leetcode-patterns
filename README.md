# leetcode-patterns
## documenting all patterns of leetcode problems with solutions 
### Patterns :
1. Sliding Window
2. Subset
3. Binary Search modified
4. Top k elements
5. DFS Binary tree
6. Topological sort
7. Binary tree BFS
8. 2 pointers

### sliding window:
so the logic is that the 2 pointers maintain a "window" over part of the input - substring of the input. they expand or shrink window depending on the conditions.
when do you use it ?
mostly when there are substrings or subarrays to be checked, and problems that ask for max/min length or sum or diff that satisfies some condition.
